    "overview": "The most straightforward way to customize queries chart is by using a configuration object whose properties describe the behavior and appearance of the chart. Since query-overview is a Webcharts `chart` object, many default Webcharts settings are set in the [defaultSettings.js file](https://github.com/RhoInc/query-overview/blob/master/src/defaultSettings.js) as [described below](#webcharts-settings). Refer to the [Webcharts documentation](https://github.com/RhoInc/Webcharts/wiki/Chart-Configuration) for more details on these settings.\nIn addition to the standard Webcharts settings several custom settings not available in the base Webcharts library have been added to query-overview to facilitate data mapping and other custom functionality. These custom settings are described in detail below. All defaults can be overwritten by users.",
